# Life of Learning
This repo is just me trying to learn about the world. There are articles, examples, and practice sections.

I am trying to get both breadth and depth with these articles. There is sooo much to learn, gotta start somewhere.

Currently, I have articles on 

* Operating Systems 
* Cache 
* Economics
* Golang
* Habatica
* Internet Scale
* Linux
* Networks
* Parallel Computing 
* Philosophy
* Psychology
* Quantative Finance
* Computer Safety and Ethics
* World History
   * India
   * Little Ice Age
* Bash
* Awk, Sed, Grep
* Docker
* Postgres
* Silicon Valley
* Veganism

They are all in a perpetual state of work in progress (WIP). 

Why is this on Github? Because I want *others* to contribute! Please join me in becoming more informed people! Note, if you contribute, you will get credit both from github by default, and from me! So please, please, please join me in learning all about the world!



**Enjoy, and remember - Ideas Win!**
