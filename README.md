# Life of Learning
This repo is just me trying to learn about the world. There are articles, examples, tests, leetcode problems, and sooo much more. Note that there is a strong focus on Golang as this repo was originally meant exclusively to learn Golang. Now it is more varied.

Note that the way this repo works is that:
if there is a file:  
    
    */articles/Networking/myfile.md*  

then all images for this file are stored in  
    
    *articles/Networking/myfile/...*  





**Enjoy, and remember - Ideas Win!**
