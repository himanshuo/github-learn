# Assignments Directory Structure
The subfolders inside a given topic in assignments contain pictures for articles.  Do **NOT** store information files (doc, docx, txt, md) inside folders whose purpose is to store images.  

For example:

if there is a file:  

    articles/Networking/myfile.md

then all images for this file are stored in  

    articles/Networking/myfile-images/...

thus do not store anything inside

    articles/Networking/myfile-images/
