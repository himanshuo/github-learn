There are three main bodies of code
  * kernel
  * system libraries
  * system utilities

there are two modes - user and kernel. Kernel is more priviliged instructions.

user mode programs has multiple shells, including bash (bourne-again shell)

### kernel
kernel is responsible for maintaining important abstractions of the OS

kernel code executes in kernel mode with full access to all physical resources of computer

all kernel code and data structures are kept in the same address space

### system libraries
system libraries define standard set of functions through which applications interact with kernel

the system libraries functionalities for which you do not need full kernel mode privileges

### system utilities
system utilities perform individual specialized management tasks

# Kernel Modules

# Process Management
# Scheduling
# Memory Management
# File Systems
# Input and Output
# Interprocess Communication
# Network Structure
# Security
