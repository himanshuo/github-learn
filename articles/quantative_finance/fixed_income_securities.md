Fixed Income Securities
========================

### What is a fixed-income security?

fixed-income security = investment that provides return in form of
* fixed periodic payments and
* the eventual return of principal at maturity

You can compare them to variable-income securities where the payments are based on some external changing measurement like short-term interest rates. **The key idea for fixed-income securities is that the payments are known in advance**.


The payment can be in various different types.
* coupon payment - annual interest rate paid on a bond. Expressed as percentage of face value (principal).
* dividend on preferred stock - dividend accrued and paid on company's preferred stocks.  
  * dividend = portion of companies earnings
  * def(accrued) = received by someone in regular or increasing amounts over time
  * preferred stocks = 'better' stocks given in a company
    * relative to common stock
    * if company goes down, then assets of company are used to first pay off preferred stock and then, if stuff is left, to common stock
    * more income security because they pay in fixed-rate (hence why they are fixed-income securities)
* interest payment


##### Examples
* 5% fixed-rate government bond. $1,000 investment would result in annual payment of $50 until maturity when the investor would receive $1,000 back.
* treasury bonds
* certificates of deposit
* preferred stock with stated dividend rate

### bonds
bond = loan

Bonds are used for *debt financing*, where a company raises money for itself by selling a portion of itself. The company would be the issuer. The people that own the bonds are creditors.  

Bonds generally offer a lower return on investment because they guarantee income.

bonds are a type of fixed-income security



### debt security
debt security = issuer owes holder a debt.

issuer must pay interest. rate of interest is based on coupon of the bond
* interest is paid back in fixed intervals - annually, semiannually, or monthly

issue must pay back principal (face value of debt) at maturity date
* maturity date is usually more than a year
