Fixed Income Securities
========================

### What is a fixed-income security?

fixed-income security = investment that provides return in form of
* fixed periodic payments and
* the eventual return of principal at maturity

You can compare them to variable-income securities where the payments are based on some external changing measurement like short-term interest rates. **The key idea for fixed-income securities is that the payments are known in advance**.


The payment can be in various different types.
* coupon payment - annual interest rate paid on a bond. Expressed as percentage of face value (principal).
* dividend on preferred stock - dividend accrued and paid on company's preferred stocks.  
  * dividend = portion of companies earnings
  * def(accrued) = received by someone in regular or increasing amounts over time
  * preferred stocks = 'better' stocks given in a company
    * relative to common stock
    * if company goes down, then assets of company are used to first pay off preferred stock and then, if stuff is left, to common stock
    * more income security because they pay in fixed-rate (hence why they are fixed-income securities)
* interest payment


##### Examples
* 5% fixed-rate government bond. $1,000 investment would result in annual payment of $50 until maturity when the investor would receive $1,000 back.
* treasury bonds
* certificates of deposit
* preferred stock with stated dividend rate

### bonds
bond = loan

Bonds are used for *debt financing*, where a company raises money for itself by selling a portion of itself. The company would be the issuer. The people that own the bonds are creditors.  

Bonds generally offer a lower return on investment because they guarantee income.

bonds are a type of fixed-income security

##### Features of a bond
The *principal*, *maturity*, and *coupon* of a bond are fixed.
  * principal - original loan value
  * maturity - when is principal to be paid out
  * coupon - annual interest rate paid on a bond

In the US treasury, there are several categories of bond maturities
  * very short - **Money Market instruments** have maturities of less than a year
  * short - **bills** mature between 1 - 5 years
  * medium - **notes** mature between 6-12 years
  * long - **bonds** mature in more than 12 years


There are also various types of coupons.
  * zero coupon bond - bond that pays no coupons
  * fixed coupon bond - bond that pays fixed amount per time period
  * floating rate bond - bond that payed a fixed spread above a money market reference rate.
    * for example, a bond can pay out USD LIBOR + 0.20%. Thus the market reference is USD LIBOR and the fixed rate about it is the 0.20%.  
    * USD LIBOR is avg interbank interest rate bank in the London money market, which trades in USD. Yes. London.


##### Yield
yield is the rate of return from investing in a bond

yield to maturity(YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime.

current yield is annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond. This represents the return an investor would expect if they purchased the bond and held it for a year.


##### credit rating
probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates.

an issuer that is more credit worthy will be able to obtain a lower yield for its bonds.

The US Treasury bonds are often deemed the safest investment opportunity, and could be used to determine a risk-free interest rate.


##### Bond versus Stock
Bonds and stocks are often compared.

A bond is a form of a debt that the issuing entity promises to repay at some point of the time in future.

A stock is a share in the ownership of a business.

Thus there is a large difference.

### debt security
debt security = issuer owes holder a debt.

issuer must pay interest. rate of interest is based on coupon of the bond
* interest is paid back in fixed intervals - annually, semiannually, or monthly

issue must pay back principal (face value of debt) at maturity date
* maturity date is usually more than a year
