Cartesian Skepticism
====================

### Question
Is the world around us real? Or is it just something fake put in front of our eyes to blind us from the truth?

Think Matrix.

### Terms
Epistemology - branch of philosophy that studies nature and scope of knowledge

Skeptic - someone who questions whether anything can be known with certainty

Cartesian Skepticism - systematic process of being skeptical about the truth of ones beliefs. This is now a common process philosophers use when being skeptic

Empirical Beliefs - beliefs we form through use of our senses

local doubts - ability to check in with yourself and figure out that what you are experiencing is a deception. This occurs with experiences that you can step out of. For example, thinking that a tomato tastes good because it looks good. Then, when you eat the tomato, it tastes bad. You can step out of the local experience and see that you were deceived by the look of the tomato.

global doubt - experience that you cannot step out of and thus not figure out whether it is a deception or not. Matrix.

Radical Skepticism - all senses, experiences, beliefs, and thoughts put into our head. None actually exist.

### Global Doubt Example
what if the universe was created 5 minutes ago?

The creator of the universe would have designed the universe to make it seem as if everything was already existing. This would help humans because it would allow us to feel like things are old. Thus we could use that experience to more forward. But in reality, nothing actually existed.

"I think, therefore, I am." - Descartes famous revelation. If I am able to doubt, then I must exist as something that has the ability to doubt.  I cannot doubt that I am a mind with thoughts. Yes, my thoughts could be controlled. But the fact that I am having them still means that I am a mind with thoughts.

Foundational Belief -  "I think, therefore, I am."

### People who have asked this question
Plato - Plato's allegory of the cave

Socrates - talked about how little he knew about the world

Ren√© Descartes (17th century mathematician) - started the big question about "how do i know what I know"

Bertrand Russel - illustrated global doubt



### Progression of 'understanding' ~ Descartes
1. its easy to be skeptic of things
2. we all learn overtime that some of our truths were lies - toothfairy, the way the world works, what is important in the world ...
3. while you believed those things, you didn't realize they were false.
4. what if that is happening right now?
5. to figure out what you think is correct, but really isnt, you have to disbelieve everything. Then, you can systematically figure out what to believe.
6. start with empirical beliefs
7. our senses fail us in providing us with the truth
8. our dreams feel real. but they arent. how do we know whether we are dreaming right now?
9. empirical belief doubts and dream issues are both local doubts. You can correct for them.
10. what if there is global doubt?
11. but wait, I am doubting!!!!
12. If I am doubting, then I do exist as something that doubts.
13. Now I can build up from here.
