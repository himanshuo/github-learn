      * the test subjects wanted to play even though they knew that their outcomes were already pre-determined. They wanted to play because they had a choice of guessing.
  * The first step in creating drive is giving people opportunities to make	 choices that provide	them with a sense of autonomy	and self-determination.
    * In experiments,	people are more motivated to complete difficult tasks when those chores are	presented	as decisions rather than commands

    * he learned that the marines did an expriment that showed that an internal 'locus of control' was a key reason for people to be motivated.

    * increased 'locus of control' leads is linked with academic success, higher self-motivation, and social maturity, lower incidence of stress and depression, and longer life span
