Thinking Critically
===================
Psychology is best understood when carefully and critically thinking about any given phenomenon.

Common Sense and Intuition are limited.

  * lots of bias
    * especially confirmation bias
  * humans tend to be overconfident - think we understand something when we really don't
  * hindsight makes us overconfident because we think that we would have picked the correct answer when the results are in front of us. It turns out, big new ideas are usually obvious already, but we just never saw them.

Using the Scientific Method is usually helpful in thinking critically.
