Motivation
============

Motivation = need or desire to do something

### 4 theories of motivation
* Evolutionary Perspective
* Drive reduction
* Optimal Arousal
* Hierarchy of Needs

##### Evolutionary Perspective
instincts - innate drive to act a certain way

Misguided because the presence of a tendency doesn't mean its necessarily supposed to be there. eg. smoking.

##### Drive reduction
psychological need or drive simply compels us to reduce that need

need -> action
hearing stomach growl -> get some food

incentives affect whether the action pulls us towards something or away from something

problem is that we do things all the time that are not necessarily directly a consequence of our needs. aka fasting or binge eating

##### Optimal Arousal
motivated to maintain balance between stimulation and relaxation.

##### Hierarchy of Needs
somethings more important needs than others

Three key needs are - *sex*, *hunger*, and *need to belong*.
