### Neural Communication
Neural System made up of neurons (nerve cells).
  * Dendrites - message receiving fibers in Neuron
  * Axons - message sending fibers in Neuron
  * Myelin Sheath - fatty cells that speed up impulses
    * also insulate Axons

Impulses (Action Potential) are brief electrical charge that travels down axon as it becomes Depolarized due to movement of positivly charged ions entering axon. After transmission, axom becomes Polarized as positive ions are pumped out during the Refractory Period.
