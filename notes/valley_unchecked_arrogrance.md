Silicon Valley's Unchecked Arrogance
======================================

Y combinator set up a research project that is trying to determine how can you sustain people in the US with basic income. The subjects will not have to work, but will get monthly money to keep them sustained. They say they don't understand the concept and are just trying to learn. My question is why? They are in fact profit-seeking. What future profit-seeking plans could they have with this?
  * income is going to be made by the rich
  * the poor need to be kept happy
  * this Universal Basic Income (UBI) idea is old. originally by Richard Nixon.

UBI is not good enough because people want more than just basic income. 


Silicon valley elites cannot see day to day problems the 'others' face. It is more important to help the others.
