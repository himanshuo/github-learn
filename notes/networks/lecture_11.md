# Go-Back-N Protocol

maximum window size = 2^m - 1
this is 1 less than buffer size

reciever maintains window size of 1


keep sending packets if timer runs out. HOWEVER, you only send up window_size (m) amount of packets!!!!!!!

Sn - 1 -> Sf


### Selective Repeat Protocol
enlarge window size for receiver
