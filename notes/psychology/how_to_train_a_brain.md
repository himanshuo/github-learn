How to Train a Brain
=====================

### People
Ivan Pavlov - founder of behaviorist school of thought


### Concepts
behaviorist school of thought - empirically rigorous science focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable internal mental processes

learning - process of acquiring, through experience, new and relatively enduring information or behaviors

associate learning - subject links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in a process called **conditioning**

classical conditioning - type of learning in which one learns to link two or more stimuli and anticipate events

operant conditioning - type of learning in which behavior is strengthened if followed by a reinforcer or diminished if followed by a punisher



### Experiments
* make dog drool for food. While drooling, ring bell. Dog will associate bell with food. In the future, ringing a bell will lead to drooling, just like food.

* Litter Albert Experiment - condition a phobia in a child. The child was exposed to a multitude of things and had no fear of anything. Then Albert was given a mouse to play with. Every time Albert touched the mouse, a loud sound in the background, scaring the child. Albert took the neutral stimulus of the rat and conditioned it to be like the natural stimulus of loud noises.

### Techniques
* classical conditioning
* operating conditioning

##### Classical Conditioning
type of learning in which one learns to link two or more stimuli and anticipate events

Make dog drool when ringing bell is an example

Little Albert Experiment is another example

##### Operant Conditioning
positive/negative reinforcement


shaping - reinforcer's guide behavior towards closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior

successive approximations - each new closer tier to desired behavior

negative reinforcement is **not** the same as punishment. Punishment is a negative consequence of doing some task. Negative Reinforcement is removing the punishing event to increase a behavior.
* For example, I do not like to touch stoves because they are hot. If I am near a stove, I will not touch it. Negative Reinforcement would mean that I make it so touching the stove does not burn me. In the future, if I near the stove, I am more likely to touch it.  


Primary Reinforcers - innately reinforcing stimulus. These satisfy a biological need.
* positive examples: cookies, chips,
* negative examples:  beeps, loud noises,

Conditioned Reinforcer - stimulus that gains its reinforcing power through its association with a primary reinforcer
* positive examples: check, good grade, money
* negative examples:  

Reinforcement Schedules - pattern that defines how often a desired response will be reinforced

Extinction - if stimulus does not occur, then the desired behavior quickly dwindles
