### Main Memory Management

##### logical-to-physical address binding

**logical address space (LAS)**  
IMAGE
program is put anywhere in memory. It will likely not start at memory spot 0. 


relocation - can find the memory object regardless of where value is loaded into memory
absolute - R1 is absolute. It is always in same place regardless of where code is used.





static binding/assignment: before program is running, take care of all relocatable items
dynamic binding/assignment: while program is running, take care of all relocatable items
  * earliest moment is when you write program

Contiguous memory management
