Docker
=======

Docker is like Github
  There is a remote docker container that you 'pull' and 'run'
  example 'pull':
    docker pull tp33/django:1.0
      tp33 is the user name
      django is the container to pull
      1.0 is the version of that container to pull
  example 'run':
    docker run -it --name web tp33/django:1.0
      -i starts interactive container so that you can access it via commandline
      -t creates pseudo-TTY that attaches stdin and stdout
      --name specifies the name of the container. In this case, the name is web
      tp33/django:1.0 is the IMAGE.
      if you write anything past the given docker run command, then docker will
        treat that as commands you want to run inside the image
      --link mysql:db tp33/django:devel
        this is for linking this docker container to another.
        mysql:db is <other_container_name>:<host_on_other_container>
        tp33/django:devel is <this_container_name>:<desired_image_on_this_container>
        
Committing (saving) a container state
  an IMAGE is a saved state of the container
    notably, when you commit your container, you only store the diff between
    the source image and your current image. Thus saving is cheap.

CONTAINERS RUN JOBS. The STATE of a CONTAINER is an IMAGE.


Useful Commands:
  get a container running:
    docker pull <name_of_container>
    docker stop <name_of_container>
    docker start <name_of_container>
    docker restart <name_of_container>
    docker kill <name_of_container>
    docker rm <name_of_container>
      container must be stopped before you can remove it

  view container information:
    docker ps
      see status of RUNNING containers
    docker ps -a
      see the status of all containers
    docker images
      lists all images

  Commit (save) your current container as new IMAGE
    docker commit <name_of_container> <some_name_to_call_image>

  Restart your container:
    docker start <name_of_container>
    then you need to attach to it so that you can work within it in an interactive commandline
    docker attach <name_of_container>
