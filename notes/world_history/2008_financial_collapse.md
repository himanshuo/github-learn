# US 2008 Financial Collapse
## Summary
The US 2008 financial collapse was brought on by
- American banks selling bonds in the housing market that were not good
- American banks telling others that these bonds were good
- American credit agencies giving these bonds high ratings, even though they were undeserving
- American credit worrying that if they did not give the bad bonds high ratings, that the banks would go elsewhere to get the ratings. The credit rating agencies would thus lose business.

## Banking Then and Now
Banking used to be a profitable, but not ridiculously profitable. Banking used to be about 10% of the US economy in the 1940s. It grew to 43% by 2006, and 56% in 2011. There are 5 big banks today - JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.
