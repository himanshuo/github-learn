microservices
=============
The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

Benefits of microservices:
* strong module boundaries
* independent deployment
* technology diversity
Problems with microservices:
* distributed systems are hard to program since remote calls are slow and always at risk of failure
* eventual consistency
* operational complexity
